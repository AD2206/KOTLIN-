  //var //val
  //in var (keyword can be modified)
  //in val(keyword cannot be modified)
  //Following code below is a  basic example code. An introduction to variables in kotlin
  fun main() {
      var name = "Aryan" //string (text)
      val birthyear = 2006 //int (number)    

      println(name)
      println(birthyear)
  }
  //Kotlin understands Aryan is a string and 2006 is an integer
  //However it is optional to specify
  //An variable can be declared without assigning a value. However, for this case the type must be specified otherwise it will generate an error
